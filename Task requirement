Project Title:

Spatio-Temporal Hotspot Detection and Trend Analysis of Road Crashes in Victoria

Guiding Question(s)

The project seeks to answer the following guiding questions:

Where are the most frequent and severe road crash hotspots located across Victoria?

When (time of day, day of week, season) do crash risks peak in these locations?

How do crash trends evolve over time, and can we detect emerging high-risk areas?

Can streaming data be used to provide real-time insights or alerts about crash trends using Kafka?

How I Will Answer the Guiding Question (Practical Work)

To answer these questions, the following practical steps will be taken:

Data Acquisition and Preparation:

Download the Victorian Road Crash Dataset from the Open Data Portal
.

Clean and preprocess the data using R (handle missing values, convert date/time columns, and ensure geographic coordinates are properly formatted).

Data Streaming and Integration (Kafka):

Use Apache Kafka to simulate or stream crash data in real time.

Set up Kafka producers (to send crash data records) and consumers (in R, to process and visualize data dynamically).

Demonstrate how Kafka can support real-time hotspot detection or trend monitoring.

Exploratory and Spatial Analysis (in R):

Use ggplot2, sf, and leaflet packages to map crash locations and visualize spatial density.

Apply spatial clustering methods (e.g., K-means, DBSCAN, or Kernel Density Estimation) to identify crash hotspots.

Temporal and Trend Analysis:

Use R’s time-series libraries (e.g., forecast, tsibble, prophet) to analyze trends by hour, day, and year.

Detect seasonal patterns and time-based variations in crash frequency.

Spatio-Temporal Insights:

Combine spatial and temporal outputs to show how hotspots change over time.

Present findings through interactive dashboards or animated visualizations (e.g., Shiny, gganimate).

Reporting and Interpretation:

Interpret hotspot patterns and trends.

Discuss how this analysis could help policymakers plan road-safety measures or resource allocation.
